        "answer": "Polymorphism is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. In Python, polymorphism enables methods in different classes to share the same name but behave differently based on the object calling them. This enhances code flexibility and maintainability by promoting reusability and reducing redundancy.Types of Polymorphism in Python Method Overriding (Runtime Polymorphism): This occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its parent class. The method in the subclass overrides the method in the parent class, allowing the subclass to define its own behavior Method Overloading (Compile-Time Polymorphism): Python does not support traditional method overloading (same method name with different parameters) as seen in some other languages like Java or C++. However, you can achieve similar behavior by using default arguments or variable-length arguments. Here, the add method adapts to different numbers of arguments, mimicking method overloading. ",
